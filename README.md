# ML65

This is my third major rebuild of the Filco Minila with TMK firmware.

This differs from the others in that:

- I have completely removed the Filco circuit board from the key switches. There is no patching into the original board anymore
- This keyboard is built with the intention to be used under Linux rather than MacOS.
- I am going to build the chassis from wood rather than my previously used Lego prototypes.
