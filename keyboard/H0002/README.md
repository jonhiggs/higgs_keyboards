## Improvements for this prototype over H0001

- Minimise the usage of rare or unusual key sizes.
- Conventionally place alpha/numeric keys letters.
- Increase size to 75%.

Remain the same:

- Delete above Enter.
- Esc above Tab.
- Ctrl below Tab.
- A narrow Spacebar.
- Tmux prefix key at the bottom-left.
- Blue switches

Changes:
- I've changed the switches from Cherry to Gateron.
- Reduced the width of space from 3u to 2.75u.
- Introduce F-Keys
- Introduce physical Page Up/Down keys.
- Moved the Z,X,C row 0.25u to the right.
- [MPT](https://matt3o.com/about-mt3-profile-and-devtty-set/) profile keycaps.

Changes to the case:

- Chamfer to reduce corners from chipping out.
- Use half-blind dovetails to improve the appearance of faces.
- Recess R0 less.
- Brass control plate.

Compromises
- Vim layout arrows rather than normal.
